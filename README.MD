# UCSC GeneDaVis

UCSC GeneDaVis is a browser plugin for visualizing gene expression data from the UCSC Genome project and its interaction with user-provided molecules. The plugin leverages OpenMM, a molecular dynamics simulation library, to simulate and visualize the interaction between gene expression and molecules.

## Features

- Connects gene expression data with user-provided molecules
- Simulates the interaction between gene expression and molecules using OpenMM
- Visualizes the molecular dynamics of the interaction

## Installation

To use UCSC GeneDaVis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open your Google Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer mode by toggling the switch in the upper-right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned/downloaded the source code.
5. The UCSC GeneDaVis plugin should now appear in your list of installed extensions.

## Usage

1. Open the UCSC Genome project website in Google Chrome.
2. Provide your gene expression data on the website.
3. UCSC GeneDaVis will connect the data with the user-provided molecules and simulate the interaction.
4. The molecular dynamics of the interaction will be visualized in the browser.
